Critique and Suggestions for Four Vega-Lite Visualizations
1. Map - Average Malaysian Ringgit Exchange Rates (2024)
Critique: The log scale and detailed color scheme add complexity, making it hard for users to quickly understand the exchange rate variations.
Suggestion: Simplify by offering a linear scale option and using a more intuitive sequential color palette with fewer steps. Add more granular zoom control and regional filters to focus on specific geographic areas and improve usability.

2. Scatter Plot - Top Malaysian Companies by Financial Metrics
Critique: The axis scaling hides smaller values, making it difficult to see lower-range data, while overlapping text labels make the plot harder to read.
Suggestion: Introduce logarithmic scaling or allow zooming to enhance visibility of small values. Additionally, implement dynamic label adjustments or display text only for companies with significant metrics to declutter the chart and improve readability

3. Line Chart - Monthly Interest Rates (Bank Negara Malaysia)
Critique: The use of "trail" marks for showing interest rates introduces unnecessary visual noise, with some lines becoming too thick.
Suggestion: Replace the "trail" marks with standard lines to emphasize smooth transitions between rate points. Additionally, reducing the number of distinct colors used for different rates can prevent visual clutterâ€”group similar rates to highlight meaningful comparisons.

4. Heatmap of Interest Rates Over Time
Critique: The heatmap struggles to show clear time-based trends, as it visualizes changes in a blocky and non-continuous manner.
Suggestion: Switch to a line chart to better capture the flow of interest rate changes over time. This would allow clearer identification of rises, drops, and trends in rates, making it easier to interpret the data.

Overall Summary: 
- Chart Types: Choose visualization types that best reflect trends (e.g., line charts for time series) and comparisons (e.g., scatter plots with appropriate scaling).
- Color Schemes: Simplify color ranges for easier interpretation, avoiding overwhelming users with excessive detail.
- Interactivity: Enhance the charts with more interactive elements like filters, zooming options, and region-based controls.
- Tooltips & Labels: Streamline tooltip content to only show key data, and adjust labels dynamically to reduce overcrowding in plots.
